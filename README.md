This project provides a system to calculate total salary expenditures for company departments with hierarchical employee structures. It includes a predefined company object containing departments and employees with salaries and subordinates. Key functions include calculateDepartmentSalary(department) for recursive salary calculations and calculateCompanySalary(company) for summing salaries across all departments. To use, copy the code into a JavaScript environment and call calculateCompanySalary(company) to display the total salary expenditure in the console.
